## InvenTree Translation Files

This directory contains translation files for the InvenTree mobile app.

### File Structure

**Translation Source File** - app_en.arb

This file contains the source strings for translating. If you want to add a new translatable string to the app, is must be added to this file!

**Translated Files** - <lc>/app_<lb>arb

Each directory contains a single translation output file, generated by the [crowdin translation service](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree). *Do not edit these files*

**collected** - Collected files

Before building the app, the translation files are collected from the various directories into a single directory, so they can be accessed by the app.

### Translating

DO NOT EDIT THE TRANSLATION FILES DIRECTLY!

Translation files are crowd sourced using the [crowdin service](https://crowdin.com/project/inventree). Contributions are welcomed (and encouraged!)
